Most parametric equalizers can create a curve like this one – or close.

Settings:      
480 Hz Low shelf, Gain = +2 dB
4 kHz Bell, Gain = -11 dB, Q = 1
8 kHz Bell, Gain = +8 dB, Q = 2
Master gain = 0 dB

So, when a binaural recording is made, simply add the equalizing to both channels. Then the recording is better adapted for loudspeaker reproduction.
